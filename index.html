        <h3>Just who <strong>IS</strong> that girl?</h3>
        <p> Well, it depends who's asking.  I mean, don't we all have multiple identities?
          I'm a curious creative who loves animals and is seeking balance in life.
          You know - balancing being active with the need to make a living, balancing
          being the parent I thought I would be with the **me** I need to be.
          Appreciating that with age comes wisdom, seniority, and
          confidence - and then embracing it. Letting go of the fear of who I'm *supposed* to be.</p>

          <p>Non-athlete who pretends to hate running, loves to dance, takes advantage of
          shredding it as many powder days as possible, and keeps trying to figure out surfing.</p>

          <p>Lifelong learner. Wannabe tech geek. Foodie. Dog mom. Human mom. Part introvert. Not Anti-vax,
            just Pro-information. Question asker. Semi-oblivious to pop culture.</p>

        <h3>For the awesome <strong>Dads</strong> out there...</h3>
        <p> Props to all those amazing dads who do the best for their kids, support
          their partners, and who provide much needed advice. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nj85L2r171w" target="_blank">This video</a> is for you. <br>
